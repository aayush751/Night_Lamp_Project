# Lamp Project
<hr>
This project allows users to control a virtual lamp by simply clicking a button to switch the light on or off.<br>
The JavaScript functionality, however, is the star of the show. It listens for the user's click on the button and toggles the lamp's state accordingly, creating a seamless and responsive user experience.
